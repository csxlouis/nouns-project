Users will be able to exchange their $NOUNS token for things such as merchandise, event tickets, or swap them into USDC using our partner Matcha.xyz</p>

                <p>Nouns GG is partnering with the Hall of Fame Village, home to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, to host a Smash Bros. tournament with 300+ competitors. 
                    Leveraging the venue’s state-of-the-art facilities, this event will enhance its esports profile and lay the groundwork for future large-scale events as the campus grows with new attractions like a water park and hotel.
